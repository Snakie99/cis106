# Lecture 2 Introduction to Linux Notes

## Important concepts:
* **Operating System:**
  * An operating system provides all the fundamental software, features of a computer.
* **Kernel:**
  * A software component that manages low-level features of the computer, like managing system hardware, memory, CPU time, and program interactions.
#
* **Components of an operating system:**
* **Linux :**
  * A Unix-Like Operating system, consists of a kernel, libraries, and utilities
* **Linux Characteristics:**
  * Open Source
  * Available for free
  * Has many Unix tools
  * Highly scalable and customizable
  * Many businesses and non-profits rely on Linux
  * Majority of server-applications on the internet utilize a version of Linux
  * Linux can be installed on almost any system and supports almost any processor architecture
* **GNU Toolchain:**
  * A collection of compilers, libraries, debuggers, and core utilities modled on Unix
* **Linux Distribution:**
  * Most Linux distributions are open source
  * Most distribute the software in packages, which are collections of many files
  * Either have a short release cycle or a long release cycle to provide stable environments
* **What is Ubuntu:**
  * A linux based distribution with both community and professional support
* **Ubuntu Release cycles:**
  * Regular, or Non-LTS: Shipped every six months and supported for 9 months at a time.
  * LTS (Long Term Support): Shipped every two years and is supported for 5 years.
* **What is Debian:**
  * An all-volunteer organization dedicated to developing free software, also known as the grandfather of all linux distributions
* **Different software licensing models (open source vs closed source):**
  * Open Source - may be distributed for free or for a fee, source code is given with the software.
  * Closed Source - the software is not distributed with the source code, and the user is restricted from modifying the code.
  * Freeware - software is free but it doesn't come with the source code.
  * Shareware - software is free on a trial basis.
* **The 4 Freedoms of Free Software:**
  * Freedom 0 - Use the software for any purpose
  * Freedom 1 - Examine the source code and modify it as you see fit.
  * Freedom 2 - Redistribute the software.
  * Freedom 3 - Redistribute your modified software.
* **Virtualization:**
  * Creating virtual versions of something.
  * Can be used to create multiple OSs and have them run on a single machine
* **Hypervisor and types:**
  * Software or hardware in charge of creating, managing, and running virtual machines.  All fall under two types, either client side or server side.
    * Type 1 = Bare-Metal Hypervisor - runs directly on the hardware, and is basically the OS for the physical machine.
    * Type 2 - an application version of a hypervisor that runs on top of an OS.  Most commonly used in client-side virtualization.
* **VirtualBox:**
  * A powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel virtulization product for home and enterprise use.  Has many features and is the only professional solution that is Open Source.
